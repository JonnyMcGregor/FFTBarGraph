# FFTBarGraph

This is a basic FFT program which displays realtime audio input on an FFT
bar graph. It also contains the equations for analysing the FFT data
for the estimated fundamental frequency of the input i.e. the most dominant
frequency. A sin wave is then generated at that fundamental frequency and
output through the connected audio device.
